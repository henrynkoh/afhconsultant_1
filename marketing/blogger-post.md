# The Complete Guide to Becoming an AFH Consultant in Washington State

*Everything you need to know to help clients succeed in Adult Family Home licensing*

---

## Introduction

If you're reading this, you're probably one of two people:

1. Someone interested in becoming an AFH (Adult Family Home) consultant
2. An existing consultant struggling to keep up with Washington State's complex regulations

Either way, you've come to the right place. After helping hundreds of consultants and providers navigate the AFH licensing process, I've created a comprehensive curriculum that covers everything you need to know.

## The Problem: Why AFH Consulting is Hard

Washington State has some of the most detailed regulations for Adult Family Homes in the country. The regulations span:

- **WAC 51-51-0330**: Building codes specific to AFHs
- **WAC 388-76**: DSHS licensing requirements (100+ sections)
- **RCW 70.128**: State laws governing AFH operations
- **DSHS Forms**: Multiple forms with specific requirements

Without proper guidance, consultants and their clients face:

- ❌ Failed building inspections (costing thousands in corrections)
- ❌ Rejected applications (60-day delays)
- ❌ Confused clients (lost business)
- ❌ Compliance violations (license issues)

## The Solution: A Complete Curriculum

I've created the **AFH Consultant Masterclass** - a comprehensive curriculum designed to transform you into an expert "AFH Concierge."
