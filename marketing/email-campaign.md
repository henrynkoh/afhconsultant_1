## Email 2: Educational Email (Day 3)

**Subject:** 3 Things That Fail Building Inspections (And How to Fix Them)

**Body:**

```
Hi [Name],

After reviewing hundreds of inspection reports, I've identified the top 3 failure points. Here's how to avoid them:

1. Window Sill Height (44" Maximum)
   ❌ Problem: Windows above 44" from floor
   ✅ Solution: Measure all windows. Replace if needed.
   📋 Reference: WAC 51-51-0330

2. Grab Bar Installation
   ❌ Problem: Suction cups or incorrect height (must be 33-36")
   ✅ Solution: Use our Pre-Inspection Checklist
   📋 Reference: WAC 51-51-0330 R330.8

3. Water Temperature
   ❌ Problem: Outside 105-120°F range
   ✅ Solution: Test daily at main bathroom
   📋 Reference: WAC 388-76-10750

## Email 4: Problem-Agitation-Solution (Day 14)

**Subject:** Are You Losing Clients to Failed Inspections?

**Body:**

```
Hi [Name],

Here's a question I hear a lot:

"Why do my clients keep failing building inspections?"

The answer is usually one of these:

❌ Missing critical requirements (grab bars, window sizes)
❌ Not using a pre-inspection checklist
❌ Unclear on WAC 51-51-0330 requirements
❌ Rushing the preparation process

The result?
- Lost clients
- Damaged reputation
- Wasted time and money

But it doesn't have to be this way.

The AFH Consultant Masterclass gives you:
✅ Complete Pre-Inspection Checklist
✅ All WAC requirements explained
✅ Room-by-room verification guide
✅ Common failure points identified

Stop losing clients. Start winning.

## Email 7: Educational Series (Day 35)

**Subject:** BAAU Application: The 60-Day Rule (Critical!)

**Body:**

```
Hi [Name],

Quick but critical information about BAAU applications:

⏰ The 60-Day Correction Window

If BAAU requests corrections, you have exactly 60 calendar days to respond.

Miss the deadline = Voided application = Start over

Here's how to avoid this:

1. Check email daily (including spam folder)
2. Respond immediately when requested
3. Use Application Readiness Audit before submitting
4. Keep copies of everything

The Application Readiness Audit (included in curriculum) prevents 98% of application returns.
